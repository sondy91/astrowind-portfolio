## Intro

I should clarify from the start that I don't think blogging or creating this post is a mistake. I've never blogged before or been very good at writing papers or things in school. I definitely didn't write for fun. I do write a lot of code, and while different in approach, I think there are some similarities I've seen so far.

## Parallels between blogging and coding

You never get it right the first time. Even though I've thought about a problem and maybe written some pseudocode, I've never run my code right after finishing writing it and had it work without any issues. I've usually had to go back and refactor a piece after realizing a flaw in my design or finding a typo. This post will be just the same. I will finish writing it and probably find something I could have done better or had an idea I didn't think of before. That's okay with me.

## Why I'm starting blogging

I want to try something new here and just start writing. I am generally a planner and thinker. I'm not very rash or quick to jump into things. Over the years, I've learned that reading up on something or thinking about it doesn't necessarily make you better in practice. I need to actually write and create. It will take time and consistent effort, learning from my mistakes. This post is one of those opportunities. Usually, the first attempt at something new is probably the worst, but it's nice to think that it will only get better from here.

## Mistakes I will probably make

There will be many along the way and that's part of the journey. They are all opportunities to learn from and improve upon. I think I'm going to probably make classical mistakes like grammatical errors, not be concise enough, picking topics all over the place, etc. But there is one I know I won't make: never starting.

## The end?

While this is where I wrap up my first post, it definitely won't be the last. My goal is to try and do this once a week. We will see if that is something I can keep up on but I feel that is a good balance of not too often but soon enough that I keep writing regularly. I'm looking forward to what I get to put out there in the future, and I hope you will come along for the ride!
